PROJECT DESCRIPTION This project involves retrieving and visualizing real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API, demonstrating how Python can be used for API integration and data analysis done on jupyter notebook. The primary goal is to fetch essential weather details for a specific city, structure the retrieved data efficiently, and present it using engaging visualizations. The implementation begins with sending an API request to OpenWeatherMap using Python’s requests library. This request retrieves crucial weather attributes, including temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and a descriptive weather condition. Once the response is obtained, the data is formatted into a Pandas DataFrame, making it easier to analyze and manipulate. This ensures structured storage and allows users to process the information seamlessly. To enhance interpretability, the project applies data visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn. A bar chart is created to represent temperature, humidity, and pressure values, making weather trends more accessible and comprehensible. The graph’s color palette is carefully selected to improve readability, and a theme-based styling ensures that the visual representation remains professional and easy to interpret.# API-INTEGRATION-AND-DATA-VISUALIZATION
